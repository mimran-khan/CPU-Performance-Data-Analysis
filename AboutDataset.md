# Computer Hardware Dataset

## Overview

The Computer Hardware dataset consists of relative CPU performance data. It was collected to study the relationship between the characteristics of computer hardware and their performance.

- **Dataset URL**: [Computer Hardware Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/29/computer+hardware)
- **Number of Instances**: 209
- **Number of Attributes**: 10 (6 predictive attributes, 2 non-predictive attributes, and 1 target attribute)

## Attribute Information

1. **Vendor Name**: Vendor of the CPU
2. **Model Name**: Model of the CPU
3. **MYCT (machine cycle time in nanoseconds)**: Predictive attribute
4. **MMIN (minimum main memory in kilobytes)**: Predictive attribute
5. **MMAX (maximum main memory in kilobytes)**: Predictive attribute
6. **CACH (cache memory in kilobytes)**: Predictive attribute
7. **CHMIN (minimum channels in units)**: Predictive attribute
8. **CHMAX (maximum channels in units)**: Predictive attribute
9. **PRP (published relative performance)**: Target attribute
10. **ERP (estimated relative performance)**: Non-predictive attribute

## Downloading the Dataset

## Data Pre-processing and Cleaning

1. **Loading Data**:
   - Import the data into your environment using pandas or any other data handling library.

2. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Check for any missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., using mean/median imputation or removing rows).

3. **Outliers**:
   - Identify and handle outliers using appropriate methods such as the IQR method or Z-score method.

4. **Skewness**:
   - Check for skewness in the data and apply transformations like log or square root transformation to normalize skewed distributions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Sanity Check**:
   - Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure and the types of data contained.

2. **Visualizations**:
   - Use histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to visualize the distribution of individual attributes and relationships between them.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Compute and visualize the correlation matrix to understand relationships between predictive attributes and the target attribute.

## Feature Engineering

1. **Transformation**:
   - Apply transformations such as standardization or normalization to the data depending on its structure.

2. **Feature Importance**:
   - Use methods like correlation analysis or feature importance from machine learning models to select important features.

## Model Building

1. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80%-20% and 10%-90% splits) with proper justification.

2. **Cross-validation**:
   - Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness and prevent overfitting.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train a Linear Regression model using sklearn or other libraries.
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

## Conclusion

Summarize the findings from your analysis, data preprocessing, and model building. Discuss the performance of your model and potential improvements for future work.
